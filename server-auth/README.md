# Server-side login option

GitHub Pages is static hosting. A password written in `index.html` only hides the screen; it does not protect `data.js` or API responses. Real login validation needs a server API that checks the password before returning protected data.

This folder contains a Cloudflare Worker template for that server API.

The current frontend is wired to use this API when `window.SERVER_AUTH_API_BASE` is set before the main script runs. Until a Worker URL is configured, the existing client-side lock remains as a fallback so the live site does not break.

## What changes

- Password is not stored in `index.html`.
- Browser sends password to `/api/login`.
- Worker validates it against a secret hash stored in Cloudflare environment variables.
- Worker sets an `HttpOnly` session cookie.
- Protected APIs, such as `/api/news`, return data only when that cookie is valid.
- Coinness news is stored and returned as preview-only data. Full original text is intentionally not stored.
- Board attachments can be stored in the private Cloudflare R2 bucket bound as `BOARD_MEDIA_BUCKET`.
- New members enter an email address and choose their own password, then wait for approval in the site admin panel.
- Member passwords must be 8-20 characters, include both an English letter and a number, and cannot repeat the same character more than four times in a row.
- Member passwords are stored only as salted `PBKDF2-SHA256` hashes using 100,000 iterations. Plaintext passwords are never emailed to the administrator or saved in member records. Existing 210,000-iteration hashes remain valid. The current count is chosen to keep signup and login within the Cloudflare Workers Free CPU allowance.
- Approved members log in with their email address and chosen password. When a verified sender is configured, a forgotten password can be reset with a one-time code sent to that member's own email address.
- Membership approval grants main-site access, board reading, and attachment downloads to every approved member. `board-write-approve` separately allows posts, comments, uploads, and managing content. Revoking writing preserves read access; revoking board access removes both. Existing memberships migrate once to read-only under `boardPermissionVersion: 2`; old combined board approvals no longer grant writing. New writing approvals and explicit revocations are preserved after migration. Pending, rejected, and blocked members still cannot log in.
- Members with writing approval may create 3 posts per calendar day in Asia/Seoul. Deleting a post does not refund its quota; comments and edits do not count, and administrators are exempt. The Worker commits the post and per-member daily counter in one storage transaction. Counters are included in daily backups.
- Run `node --test server-auth/board-permissions.test.mjs server-auth/security-regression.test.mjs` from the repository root to check permissions and post limits.

## Required Cloudflare Worker environment variables

- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`
  - Example: `https://fnfnfn3232.github.io`
- `SITE_PASSWORD_SHA256`
  - SHA-256 hex of the site password.
- `SESSION_SECRET`
  - Long random string used to sign session cookies.
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
  - Optional Resend API key used only by the Worker to send login codes.
- `RESEND_API_KEY_2`
  - Optional key from a second Resend account. Use this when `OTP_EMAIL_TO_2` differs from the first Resend account email and no verified sender domain is configured.
- `OTP_EMAIL_TO`
  - First private destination address for login codes. Keep it as a Worker/GitHub secret.
- `OTP_EMAIL_TO_2`
  - Optional second private destination address. Only these registered addresses can request a code.
- `OTP_EMAIL_FROM`
  - Optional verified sender for member password-reset and status emails, for example `ComaCap <login@your-domain.example>`.
  - Member signup and administrator approval work without this setting.
- `MEMBER_REGISTRATION_ENABLED`
  - Optional. Set to `false` to hide and disable new signup requests without deleting existing members.
- `NEWS_LIMIT`
  - Optional. Coinness currently accepts up to 40 per fetch; keep this at `40`.
- `NEWS_STORE_LIMIT`
  - Optional. The Worker keeps up to 1000 merged Coinness items for paging and search.
- `NEWS_CACHE_SECONDS`
  - Optional. Default/recommended value is `600` seconds, so Coinness is fetched at most about once every 10 minutes per active Worker isolate.
- `BOARD_MEDIA_BUCKET`
  - R2 bucket binding used for board attachments.
  - Recommended bucket name: `coin-board-media`.
  - Keep the bucket private. Downloads should continue through `/api/board/media/...`, where the Worker checks both login and board approval first.

## Generate password hash

In PowerShell:

```powershell
$password = "your-password-here"
$bytes = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($password)
$hash = [Security.Cryptography.SHA256]::Create().ComputeHash($bytes)
($hash | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("x2") }) -join ""
```

## API shape

Login:

```http
POST /api/login
Content-Type: application/json

{"password":"..."}
```

Member password login:

```http
POST /api/login/member/password
Content-Type: application/json

{"email":"member@example.com","password":"the member password"}
```

Member signup stores a pending approval request with the email address and password chosen on the site:

```http
POST /api/signup/request
Content-Type: application/json

{"email":"member@example.com","password":"the member password"}
```

The submitted email address is not verified. Review the applicant in the site admin screen and approve only people you recognize. Passwords are stored only as salted PBKDF2 hashes.

If a verified sender is configured, forgotten passwords can be reset with a 10-minute code delivered to the approved member's own email:

```http
POST /api/member/password/reset/request
POST /api/member/password/reset/confirm
```

News:

```http
GET /api/news?limit=40&offset=0&q=검색어
Cookie: coin_board_session=...
```

Logout:

```http
POST /api/logout
```

## Important limitation

This protects data served by the Worker. It does not protect any data that is still committed into public `data.js`, `board_snapshot.json`, or the GitHub repository. News lists should stay in the Worker store instead of the GitHub Pages data files.

Also, do not reuse the old client-side password as the Worker password after deployment. The old password has already existed in public frontend code. Use a new password when setting `SITE_PASSWORD_SHA256`.

## Frontend hookup

After the Worker is deployed, add this before the main inline script in `index.html`:

```html
<script>
  window.SERVER_AUTH_API_BASE = "https://coin-board-auth.your-subdomain.workers.dev";
</script>
```

Then remove the legacy client-side fallback password from `index.html` once the Worker login is confirmed.

## Deploy with GitHub Actions

This repo includes `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml`.

Add these GitHub repository secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `SITE_PASSWORD_SHA256`
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional, required for email code login)
- `RESEND_API_KEY_2` (optional key for the second destination when using the default Resend test sender)
- `OTP_EMAIL_TO` (optional, required for email code login)
- `OTP_EMAIL_TO_2` (optional second permitted email address)
- `OTP_EMAIL_FROM` (optional; use a Resend-verified sender domain for member password-reset and status emails)

The deploy workflow creates and uses two private R2 buckets:

- `coin-board-media`: live board attachments
- `coin-site-backups`: encrypted database snapshots and attachment backup copies

No public R2 URL or download route is enabled for `coin-site-backups`. The Cloudflare API token needs permission to deploy Workers and manage/read/write R2 buckets.

## Member and attachment security

- Active members can read/download. Posting requires a separate administrator grant and remains limited to three new posts per Korea calendar day.
- Only the owning member or an authenticated administrator can modify/delete a post or comment. Legacy post passwords no longer bypass member ownership. Records without a member owner are administrator-managed.
- Upload sessions are bound to the initiating account. Chunk writes and completion are serialized per upload; temporary Durable Object chunks are removed after completion. In-progress legacy member uploads without ownership metadata must be restarted after deployment.
- JSON/form/password API bodies are capped at 256 KiB while streaming. Binary requests are capped at 8 MiB. The normal chunked uploader still supports files up to 200 MiB. This is not an aggregate storage quota.
- All administrator password checks share the login failure limit, including concurrent requests. The public Worker overwrites the internal client-IP forwarding header.
- A login expires at its original 24-hour deadline; page reloads and session checks preserve that deadline instead of silently extending it. The explicit session-extension endpoint starts a new 24-hour window and is limited to three uses per session in server storage. Retrying the same extension request is idempotent. Explicit logout revokes the full session identity, including extended token copies, and removes its extension record. Existing cookies and member approvals do not require a migration.
- An explicit bearer token cannot inherit a different account's cookie privileges. Authentication fails closed when the authentication storage binding is absent.
- Board mutations are serialized because posts/comments/views share a single storage record.

Run `node --test server-auth/board-permissions.test.mjs server-auth/security-regression.test.mjs` for permission, concurrency, session, upload, request-size and existing HTML/download-header regressions. These are isolated tests, not a third-party penetration test.

Attachments are served through the authenticated Worker with restrictive content types and response headers. No antivirus engine scans attachment contents: downloaded archives, executables, documents or HTML may still be unsafe when opened locally. Never publish private member or board data into the public GitHub repository; static GitHub files are not protected by the Worker login.

## Automatic R2 backups

The Worker runs a scheduled backup every day at 03:17 KST (18:17 UTC).

- Database data is serialized and encrypted with AES-256-GCM before it is written to `database/YYYY-MM-DD.cbk`.
- Daily database snapshots are kept for at least 30 days, with a one-day pruning safety margin after the lock expires.
- R2 attachment chunks are copied incrementally to the `media/` prefix. A scheduled run copies up to 50 missing chunks so normal Worker traffic is not crowded out.
- Legacy attachments that still live in the Durable Object are copied to `legacy-media/`.
- Deleting a live attachment does not automatically delete its backup copy.
- The latest successful run summary is stored privately as `status/latest.json`.
- R2 bucket lock rules protect `database/`, `media/`, and `legacy-media/` objects from deletion or overwrite for 30 days. `status/latest.json` stays unlocked so the daily status can be updated.
- The deploy workflow preserves unrelated bucket lock rules and fails deployment if these three protection rules cannot be applied and verified.

The encryption key is derived from `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` when that optional Worker secret exists. Otherwise the existing `SESSION_SECRET` is used, so no extra setup is required. Keep the secret used for encryption: changing or losing it makes older encrypted snapshots impossible to restore.

Korean GitHub menu path:

1. Repository page
2. `Settings`
3. `Secrets and variables`
4. `Actions`
5. `New repository secret`

After all four secrets are added:

1. Go to `Actions`
2. Select `Deploy Cloudflare Worker`
3. Select `Run workflow`

The Worker name is `coin-board-auth`. After a successful deploy, Cloudflare will show a URL similar to:

```text
https://coin-board-auth.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Use that URL as `window.SERVER_AUTH_API_BASE`.

Last deployment trigger prepared at 2026-06-12 17:16:37 +09:00.
